# Introduction to JSON Data  

## Background  

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is simply a method for writing out data objects using the JavaScript language for quick and efficient transmission between servers and browsers. JavaScript is a lightweight programming language with less syntax notation that makes it easy to read, write, and store data. The lightweight structure of JSON makes it a great way to quickly and efficiently send large amounts of data with minimal wait time and storage size.  

JSON is commonly used when creating and consuming data via API connections. It can ingest text strings, numbers, boolean values, `null` values, arrays, and objects into long strings of text that get delivered to a client for processing. An example from the [Mozilla Developers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) webpage helps illustrate how data describing a superhero, "Molecule Man", would look in JavaScript format within a JSON file:  

`{"name":"Molecule Man","age": 29,"secretIdentity":"Dan Jukes","powers":["Radiation resistance","Turning tiny","Radiation blast"]}`

This file can be received and unpackaged by a browser for parsing back into a consumable format, such as:

```{r molecule.png, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/moleculeMan.PNG")
```

More information on JSON including its history and usage can be found in the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) community. The following sections will look further into how JSON files can be unpackaged and parsed into R, including an example connection to an API for the National Hockey League (NHL).  

## Reading JSON DATA into R  

Discuss the possible packages/functions that are available for reading JSON data into R.  
rjson & rjsonio
jsonlite & httr
tidyjson & dplyr

### Package 1  

Details on available package 1 (to be named).  

### Package 2  

Details on available package 2 (to be named).  

### Package 3  

Details on available package 1 (to be named).  

## Package for this Vignette  

Name which package will be used in the upcoming API call to NHL records, and why.  

# NHL Franchise API  

## Background  

Provide info on the NHL, available tables from records.nhl.com, which tables will be explored using the selected function.  

## Establishing API Connection  

Code chunk for the API and returning parse data from the selected tables.  

## Exploratory Data Analysis  

### The Data  

Check for any needed formatting, create a new variable as required.  

### Numeric Summaries  

Provide contingecy tables and numeric summaries as required.  

### Visuals  

Create some plots (bar, box, scatter) with discussion of observations for each.
